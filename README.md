- **Age**: Age group of the customer (e.g., '0-17', '18-25', '26-35', etc.)
- **Occupation**: Occupation of the customer
- **City_Category**: City category where the customer resides
- **Stay_In_Current_City_Years**: Number of years the customer has stayed in the current city
- **Marital_Status**: Marital status of the customer
- **Product_Category**: Category of the purchased product
- **Purchase**: Amount spent on the purchase

### Data Inspection
The dataset was inspected for completeness and correctness. Key steps included:
- Checking for missing values
- Verifying data types
- Exploring unique values in categorical columns

### Statistical Summary
A summary of key statistical metrics was computed, including:
- Descriptive statistics for numerical features (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation)
- Distribution of categorical features (e.g., frequency counts)

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involved:
- Handling missing values
- Converting data types where necessary
- Removing duplicate records
- Encoding categorical variables for analysis

## Data Visualization
Various visualizations were used to understand the data better, including:
- Histograms for the distribution of numerical features
- Bar charts for categorical feature frequencies
- Scatter plots to explore relationships between features

## Analysis of Purchase Behavior by Gender and Other Features
